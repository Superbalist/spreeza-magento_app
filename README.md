This is the Magento app for New Zendesk. The app relies on APIs provided by the [Zendesk extension for Magento](http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/catalog/product/view/id/15129/) to display customer and order information. It is available to all Zendesk accounts via the app listing. Please submit bug reports to [Zendesk](https://support.zendesk.com/requests/new). Pull requests are welcome.
